Hotel Booking  Exploratory Data Analysis


## Summary
The main aim of this project is to perform an Explaratory Data Analysis on hotel booking analysis which investigates the different booking patterns and the customer behaviour and suggests measures that can be implemented to increase the revenue.

The project contains booking information for a city hotel and resort hotel, such as the booking date, month,year,customer information such as number of adults, children and babies.As the first step I explored the data and inspected over the duplicate values and the missing values.Then I cleaned the dataset by handling the null values and dropping the duplicate values and irrelevant data.Then it was visualized using the graphical techniques.

EDA is divided into univariate, bivariate and multi variate analysis. In univariate, data is analysed on only one variable. For example, the most preferred hotel by the customers, the busiest month, the year with most number of bookings etc.

In bivariate and mutivariate two or more than two variables are compared with each other.For example, the hotel with the highest number of cancellations are taking place, the month in which most cancellations are taking place, the number of repeated guests for each hotel etc.

From these analysis we can take measures to reduce the number of cancellations and to improve the customer service. By taking these measures we can make a revenue increase.

## Business objective
The project aims to gain the interesting insight into the different factors that affect the booking patterns and cancellations and to take measures to enhance the quality and customer satisfaction, thus by increasing the revenue.
## Data inspection
The dataset contains 119390 rows and 32 columns.It contains 31994 duplicate values.After dropping the duplicate values the columns are reduced to 87396.Total number of null values in the dataset is 87396.The columns children contains 4, country contains 452, agent contains 12193 and company contains 82137 null values.All the missing values are removed using the values '0' and 'others'.Thus the dataset is cleaned and ready for wrangling.
Variables Description
Hotel --> H1= Resort Hotel ,H2=City Hotel

is_cancelled --> If the booking was cancelled(1) or not(O)

lead_time -->Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date

arrival_date_year-->Year of arrival date

arrival_date_month-->Month of arrival date

arrival_date_week_number--> Week number for arrival date

arrival_dat_day -->Day of arrival date

stays_in_weekend_nights-->Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel

stays_in_week_nights--> Number of week nights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel

adults-->Number of adults

children-->Number of children

babies--> Number of babies
meal-->Kind of meal opted for

country--> Country code

market_segment-->Which segment the customer belongs to

Distribution _channel--> How the customer accessed the stay- corporate booking/ Direct/TA.TO

is_repeated_guest-->Guest coming for first time or not

previous_cancellation--> Was there a cancellation before

previous_bookings -->Count of previous bookings

reserved_room_type--> Type of room reserved

assigned_room_type--> Type of room assigned

booking_changes--> Count of changes made to booking

deposit_type--> Deposit type

agent -->Booked through agent
days_in_waiting_list--> Number of days in waiting list

customer_type-->Type of customer

required_car_parking-->If car parking is required

total_of_special_req--> Number of additional special requirements

reservation_status-->Reservation of status

reservation_status_date-->Date of the specific status


## Data Cleaning



Created a copy of the dataset and dropped all the duplicate values and missing values. We checked if any adult column having value '0'.Adult 0 means no booking has been happened. So we can drop those columns.Then we checked if any column with negative value for average daily rate. Negative value for average daily rate is not possible.So that column also dropped. Then we add two more columns 'total_people' by adding adults, children and babies and 'total_stay' by adding the number of stays in weekend nights and week nights.

Also one outlier found in adr column, which was then removed.
## EDA
Data analysis is performed to answer the following questions:

â€¢	Which month is the busiest month for hotels?

â€¢	Which hotel is more preferred among travelers?

â€¢	In which year most bookings happened for each type of hotels?

â€¢	Which agent made the most number of bookings?

â€¢	Which type of meal is the most preferred  by the customers?

â€¢	What is the booking cancellation percentage?

â€¢	What type  of customers are coming  to each hotel?

â€¢	From which country the most customers are coming?

â€¢	Whether the customers are repeatedly coming or not?

â€¢	Which is the most preferred room type for different types of customers?

â€¢	 Whether the customer got the reserved room type?

â€¢	Which is the most used distribution channel for booking?

â€¢	Which Hotel has the highest revenue?

â€¢	Which hotel has  the highest lead time?

â€¢	Which hotel has the history of high number of booking cancellation?

â€¢	Which hotel has the history of most repeated customers?

â€¢	Which distribution channel generates more income?

â€¢	How long people stay in hotels?

â€¢	Which hotel has longer waiting time?

â€¢	How is average daily rate related to total number of people?

â€¢	How many solo travellers, couple or family travelled  per month?

  EDA is divided into univariate, bivariate and multi variate analysis.
  
 In univariate, data is analysed on only one variable. 
               
In bivariate and multivariate,  two or more than two variables are compared with each other.

## Conclusion

The following conclusions were drawn from analysis:

â€¢	61% customers preferred city hotels. 39% customers preferred resort hotels.

â€¢	August and July are the most income generating months. January, November and December are the slowest months for both hotels

â€¢	Highest number of bookings are made in the year 2016.Least number of bookings are done in 2015.

â€¢	Most income generating agent is 9 followed by 240 and 0.

â€¢	Most preferred meal type is BB(Bed & Breakfast)

â€¢	Most profittable month for Resort hotel is August and for city hotel is May and August.

â€¢	Resort hotel has higher lead time comapared to city hotel.

â€¢	Most number of booking cancellations are in city hotels.

â€¢	Repeated customers mostly prefer the resort hotels.
â€¢	Most revenue generated market segment is Online TA.

â€¢	City hotel is busier than resort hotel.

â€¢	When the number of people increases the adr also increases.

â€¢	In the month of August most customers are couples. In July and August most of the customers are family.

â€¢	There is a positive corelation between is_canceled and days_in_waitinglist.

â€¢	There is a strong negative relation between totalof_special_requests and is_repeated guest.

â€¢	Negative corelation between is_repeated guest and adr
